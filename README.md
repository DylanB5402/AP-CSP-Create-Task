My Project for the AP Computer Science Principles Create Task

This is a Python Library made for creating interactive, text-based stories. Simply make branches, label them correctly, and create a story using an array of branches. The first branch in the list should be the start of the story.

A story is made of several branches. Each branch has a trunk, and two (or more) paths leading out from the trunk.
